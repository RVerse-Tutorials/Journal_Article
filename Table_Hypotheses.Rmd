The value to the left of $\\sim$ is the response: $S_t$ Jul-Sep catch or $N_t$ Oct-Mar catch in the current season. To the right of $\\sim$ are the explanatory variables. $S_{t-1}$ is Jul-Sep catch and $N_{t-1}$ is the Oct-Mar catch in the prior season. DD = hypotheses related to density-dependence. S = hypotheses related to catch during the spawning months. L = hypotheses related to larval and juvenile growth and survival. A = hypotheses affecting all ages. See the introduction for discussion of the literature on the effects of environmental covariates on sardine landings. ns-SST = nearshore SST. r-SST = regional (nearshore and offshore) SST. $t$, $t-1$, and $t-2$ subscripts indicate current, prior, and two seasons prior.
