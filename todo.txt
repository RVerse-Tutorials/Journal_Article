to do

Create a detailed version of the hypotheses table with references in the appendix.
Need refs for the cHl section? might already be in intro

test of autocorrelation of residuals and normality

Need to do influence analysis via cross-validation (LOO).  1994 catch is influential and outlier.

cross-validation test of the catch models

show correlation between CHl and UPW?.

add Chidambaram and Menon to refs and to section on plankton and SST cor

fix Rohit 2018 ref in endnote when return to NWFSC

Remove Jr. from Checkley

From Kripa et al 2015

It is already established that stock abundance is not necessarily related directly to landings but we assume this to be so for oil sardine because:
• Reproduction occurs near the coast so that the whole reproducing population is available for the fishery.
• Fishing effort for most of the period is artisanal.
• Total catch of the fishery is unregulated except for a brief
period of closure (that too not for Kerala coast)
• Oil sardine shoals do not perform long distance migrations like anchovies which concentrate south of Cape Comorin during the summer monsoon period and then spread northwards along the Malabar coast during the dry
season (November onwards).
