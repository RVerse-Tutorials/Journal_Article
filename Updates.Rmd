# May 10-21, 2019

Did the SST transect studies to look for better/other ways to characterize the SST gradients both temporally and spatially. This work is summarized here.

# May 8, 2019

Updated the SardineForecast package with the `tidelevel` dataset and updated the documentation under `?tidelevel`. Updated Sardine.bib with the references.

I did some cursory looking at the tide level anomalies against the catches. No obvious relationships. Studies have found a relationship between mean sea level and SOI but that relationship does not seem to hold for the whole 1939-2018 time series. It seems to hold for some shorter periods however.

Next: Re look at Dave's suggestions for how to use sea level as a covariate. Not clear to me how to use it. Also there is a strong seasonal cycle in sea level. Should one use one part of this cycle, like Sept, or just use the mean annual level?

Merged the 3 tide gauge data sets. Then 

* filled in any NAs using exponential smoothing
* created annual means
* created anomalies by removing linear trend and mean level

Next, need to update the citation and man file for the data. Create some figures for the appendices.

Working on downloading tide gauge data. The different data sets have different missing values, so I downloaded from 3 sources. Big gap 2008-2009. Tide gauge must have been broken.

* raw minute data from 2011-present http://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org/station.php
* raw daily data from 2011 http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/?fd#uh174
* monthly average data scaled to mean tide level https://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/stations/438.php

Dave suggested using SSH as a covariate however remote sensing data on SSH is only available into 1990s so not very useful.  Tide height at Cochin is available for full catch data set. Normally tide height data is corrected for inverse barometric pressure but Srinivas and Kumar (2006) looked at the difference between tide height at Cochi and the corrected sea level and found not much difference, so I'll the uncorrected tide level. Srivivas and Kumar (2006) and Srinivas et al (2005) found a relationship between sea level and ENSO phenomena.

Collecting background references for the introduction and discussion on climate forcing for small pelagics and ocean variables and sardine catch.
